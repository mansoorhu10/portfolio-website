# My Personal Portfolio Website

## How I worked on this project
My goal was to create a hyper-stylized unique personal portfolio website that's main purpose is to display summaries of projects that I have worked on.
  * I designed the entire site on Figma and brainstormed different styles for the site to have.
  * I worked with tasks on a Trello board to keep myself on track.
  * I built the site from scratch using React, React-Router-DOM, HTML and CSS.
  
## Why I built the project this way
I wanted full customization for my website and decided against using web content management systems in order to expand my knowledge using React and challenge myself improve my front-end development skills.

## Future Improvements
I had to reduce the scope of the original vision I had for the website once I realized how much time it would take me to develop it. Once I have enough time to continue working on the website, these are the primary changes and improvements I will make to the site:

  * Using react-bootstrap as a front-end framework to make sure the website is viewable through multiple window sizes and on mobile.
  * Adding more detail to the individual project pages like ```iframe``` interactivity and using gifs to display project functionality.
  * Adding more interactivity to the various windows that have a close, maximize and minimize button using React and JavaScript.
