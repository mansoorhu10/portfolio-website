        descriptionOne: "Welcome to my website. This page is dedicated to my first co-op work term that I completed in Fall 2023. I worked as a Student IT Technician co-op at Computing and Communication Services at the University of Guelph. I was a part of the Client Productivity team at Managed Desktops in CCS. The office was in the basement of Johnston Hall at the University of Guelph. I hope you take away from this page the unique skills you can learn as an IT intern and how there are transferable skills that can be helpful for a software developer or software engineer to learn that will benefit them in their career.",
        descriptionTwo: "Computing and Communication Services is the central information technology (IT) department on campus that provides services and technology support to the university community. This includes Gryph Mail, University network connectivity, Microsoft Teams, logins and passwords, information security, file storage, databases, software, web hosting, web development and personal computing infrastructure support. The core values of CCS are Service Culture, Integrity, Individual Leadership, Teamwork, Agility and Communication. Several different divisions of CCS handle different tasks. I was a part of the Client Productivity division in the Managed Desktops team which provides services like Windows and MacOS support, application software installation, system rebuilds, network file and print services and support and hardware troubleshooting and diagnosis. CCS supports more than 5, 950 employee endpoint computers through Managed Desktops as well as 746 network switches and 3, 934 wireless access points across all University of Guelph locations. Additionally, of the 800 million emails received by the University in the 2021-2022 academic year, 95% were malicious and blocked by the Information Security team at CCS (University of Guelph, 63-64).",
        descriptionThree: "My main goals for this co-op work term were to improve my oral communication, problem-solving skills, and technological literacy. I tried to develop goals that related to my job tasks to improve my effectiveness as a technician. My first goal was to effectively communicate with clients both in person and on calls. Asking good questions to the client to understand the issue at hand to help me respond to clients with fixes sooner. and in the future with understanding the requirements for a software project or feature. My second goal was to improve on troubleshooting any issues with common tasks by building a knowledge base to rely on while problem-solving. This helped me on the job by allowing me to solve issues quicker, independently and without having to rely on other technicians. It will also help me in my next work experience by improving my independent problem-solving skills. My last goal was to understand key terminology and the key differences between technical synonyms. I wanted to learn to use technological terms properly in sentences when talking about them to other technicians. This allowed me to understand the technology required for the job and gain the skill of explaining technical concepts to other people with different backgrounds and levels of understanding when it comes to technology and software. This skill is very useful for jobs that require me to directly consult clients about software requirements as well as for pitching ideas about software features. I was able to complete all of the three primary goals that I had. I understood how to follow a general process to ask questions and inquire about a ticket that properly informs me about the context of the problem. I improved how I troubleshot common issues like decommissions and application installs and contributed to documenting the standard operating procedure of computer builds by providing a list of several potential solutions to common problems that occur during the build process that I have experienced. I learned about IT technology terms and I can simplify technical concepts for clients when explaining the reasoning behind the issues they face as well as the rationale behind the solution to help them prevent the same issue from occurring in the future. I can efficiently use technologies like Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager and Active Directory to resolve issues as well as IT issue tracking software like FootPrints to document and keep track of tickets.",
        descriptionFour: "At this job, I worked closely with other technicians, analysts and co-op students to resolve tickets that were assigned to me on FootPrints. They ranged from common tasks like decommissioning computers, completing a build or rebuild of a computer, application installs, and delivering and setting up computers and monitors to issues with monitor screens or docking stations not working properly, Outlook or Adobe Acrobat settings issues, and replacing malfunctioning hardware components of laptops like fans. In many cases, I had to troubleshoot or resolve issues with processes that we follow for common tasks. I documented solutions that I found for these issues. I needed critical-thinking skills, communication skills, and the ability to use tools like Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager, Active Directory, and FootPrints to do my job effectively. I learned a majority of these skills during onboarding and throughout my co-op term.",
        descriptionFive: "Overall, I had lots of fun learning about how different technologies and systems work in an IT environment. I improved my communication, technological literacy, and problem-solving skills, which are all beneficial to my career in the software industry.",
        descriptionSix: "I want to acknowledge my manager, Brian Thomson, and the technical analyst and supervisor for my co-op term, Haniya Saleh, for their incredible work at CCS and for teaching me about how CCS works. I wanted to thank Joey Aversa, Theron Simon, Stefan Romanescu, Jeff Hamilton, James McGarry, and Jill Hogg for all of their advice and help when I worked on tickets. I also want to acknowledge the three other co-op students that I worked with throughout my co-op term: Kirisan Suthanthireswaran, Nuno Simoes, and Jonathon Kocevar. It was fun talking to and working alongside them.",

        descriptionThree: "My main goals for this co-op work term were to improve my communication skills, problem-solving skills, and technological literacy with modern technologies. I developed goals that would aid me in improving my effectiveness in making automation workflows. My first goal was to improve my oral communication with the team on calls. Being able to ask good questions to team members to clarify my understanding of tasks that I am assigned. I wanted to efficiently get through the main agenda for meetings and stay on task during meetings. I prepared for meetings appropriately and improved my responsiveness during calls by having my list of questions open for reference. This will help me in the future by allowing me to be more effective during stand-up meetings and to understand the requirements for a software project or feature. My second goal is to improve on problem-solving issues by creating automation workflows and connecting them. I wanted to build a knowledge base to rely on while independently problem-solving to create dynamic automations that include error handling. I documented any fixes to unusual issues or bugs to reference later, created modular workflows that have been tested for use in future automation workflows, and planned out the effects of automation solutions I created by using tools like Microsoft Visio. I understood how different workflows depend on each other and how they can have upstream and downstream effects. This helped me on the job by allowing me to solve issues with automations quickly and without having to rely on other team members. This will help me in the future by allowing me to grow my critical thinking skills that I will use to debug and test software. My third goal was to understand key terminology and the differences between similarly used words. I wanted the ability to use technological terms properly in sentences when talking about them to other members of the team or clients. I also wanted the ability to use technologies like Rewst and ConnectWise effectively to make comprehensive automation workflows without continuous help from other team members. I asked questions about unknown technological terms to gain a basic understanding, then researched afterward to confirm my knowledge and build on it. I practiced using platforms like Rewst and ConnectWise to get familiar with using them. I got positive feedback from team members on automations I have made that they use, I am proficient in using Rewst, ConnectWise, BrightGauge, Dialpad, Jinja and Visio. This will help me in the future by enabling me to learn new technologies and tools more easily. Overall, I was able to complete all of my goals and learn the technologies I wanted to work with.",
        descriptionFour: "At this job, I worked independently but collaborated with other technicians and managers to understand processes and issues so that I could automate them. In the first couple of weeks, I was onboarded and did training for ConnectWise and Rewst to get accustomed to these platforms. Then, I worked on creating a Daily Ticket Summary email automation. It queries the current tickets assigned to each team member and then categorizes them as High Priority, Customer Responded, Response to Completed, New, and Breaching Resolution tickets by using statuses and the available data of each ticket. Then, at the beginning of a workday, it formats the information into an email with HTML and sends it to the respective team member. This saves the team time in looking for tickets that need attention at the start of a workday and works as a good starting point to pick up on work for tickets from the previous day. I iterated on the design of the workflow and email by creating multiple different versions and used sub-workflows to create specific functionality. Next, I worked on a vacation reminder email automation. This was used to remind team members of their upcoming vacations and as a reminder to complete their pre-vacation checklist. This workflow queries data from BrightHR, which is returned as vCalendar data. Since there was no method to parse this in Rewst, I used Jinja to manually parse the data with loops and list comprehension into a convenient JSON list structure. Then, I looped through this list to check which vacation dates were in the upcoming week and sent these in an email to the respective team members as a reminder. I also worked on time entry automation. This was broken up into separate automation workflows that had some similar functionality. The three main time entry automations I worked on were Microsoft Teams time entry, Dialpad time entry, and vacation time entry. The Microsoft Teams automation queries each team member’s calendar events in the next hour based on a cron job trigger and then filters events based on many different criteria to get Teams meetings that would need time entry. Then, it sends an email to the respective member for each Teams meeting with a link to a pre-populated custom form that is used to enter time for the member. Since our team uses ConnectWise for time entry, the form takes the information and directly calls an API to submit it for the team member. Dialpad time entry works similarly, but instead of querying calls each hour, it uses a custom webhook to POST data for a call directly to a Rewst workflow once a call ends. The workflow uses the response input to filter out redundant call events and then sends an email with a pre-populated form, the same one as for Teams, to enter time against the call. The vacation time entry reuses earlier functionality from the vacation reminder email. It uses the same sub-workflow to parse event data and send an email to inform them that a time entry has been automatically created for them based on their vacation event. The most interesting aspect of my job was the tools I used to create automatons. While I am used to traditional ways of programming and creating projects using web apps, I was able to learn how to code inside of a low-code platform. This unique environment had its benefits and challenges, but I was still able to cultivate my programming skills from the experience by improving my problem-solving and communication skills when creating workflows. I also needed the ability to use tools like Rewst, ConnectWise, Dialpad, and BrightGauge, which I learned on the job through training and practice.",
        descriptionFive: "Overall, I had lots of fun learning about automation and implementing workflows in an IT setting. I improved my communication, technological literacy, critical thinking, programming, and automation skills in a unique way which is valuable to my career in the software industry.",
        descriptionSix: "I want to acknowledge my manager and COO, Jim Watson, and the CEO of Third Octet, Matthew Metelsky for teaching me so much about IT, problem-solving, and for instilling in me the curiosity to learn more. I want to thank Joe Peckford, Marlon Smith, Caroline Ware, Fatima Mendez, Gilmer Martinez, Justin Bankston, Michael Cerrato, and Jorge Maldonado for their warm welcome, their cooperation, and their feedback in the process of creating automations.

        descriptionThree: "My primary goals for this co-op work term were to improve my depth & breadth of understanding, problem-solving, and personal organization. I developed goals that would aid me in improving my effectiveness when working on projects. My first goal was to effectively understand new content that I am learning and to learn how to ask good questions to team members so that I can clarify my understanding of new technologies or tools that I learn. I can adequately research a concept or technology and explain it to other people, and I ensure that I ask questions about things that I do not understand to form a basic understanding that I can build from by reading more. This will help me in the future by allowing me to be more effective in reading documentation for learning new technologies that are required for a software project. My second goal was to improve on problem-solving any issues with programming, and to build a knowledge base to rely on while independently problem-solving to write dynamic, scalable, efficient and concise code. When working on automations and programming, I have ensured that I consider all cases of input and handle them effectively. I also took special care to consider edge cases and asked for guidance on how to handle them. This will help me in the future by allowing me to solve difficult problems that I do not have experience with and by enabling me to grow my critical thinking skills even further when I write code. My third goal was to improve in personal organization by planning out tasks that I must do and completing them based on their priority and deadline. I organized documentation and the code that I wrote. I kept track of my tasks using a to-do list and was able to re-prioritize my tasks when I was given new deadlines. I practiced good software development practices with automations and scripts by commenting effectively, making code modular, and ensuring that only necessary input is used to promote security. This will help me in the future by enabling me to keep up with critical deadlines and write code with good development habits.",
        descriptionFour: "At this job, I worked independently but also sought guidance from others regarding my work and needed to collaborate with other team members to help me complete my tasks. I worked on a variety of tasks to aid in advancing the progress of many AI projects. My role’s responsibilities varied from each project, so I developed many distinct skills. During onboarding, I did training to familiarize myself with health and safety on the job, since there are times whenI must be on the shop floor, although I was typically at my desk for most of my work. I began working by helping with an initiative to monitor vibration sensor data for the Souring machines at the plant to be used for fault detection so that we could implement predictive maintenance. I analyzed data from two different vibration sensors to find which could help us more with our goals. I did similar work with two different energy sensors that were being used similarly as well, to monitor anomalies with energy levels for different machines. Additionally, I did research on different companies that could provide us with software and cameras to create a 3D digital twin of the facility. This is a virtual representation of a physical space that can be used to take accurate measurements and for documentation. Engineers can also collaborate on planning changes made to the facility through this digital twin. In addition, I aided in research and testing for a project to count the number of steel blanks in a stack using a camera so that we could verify that our purchases of steel are accurate in an efficient way. We would use computer vision with a machine learning model from a software company to count the number of blanks in a stack from a picture. I created a prototype of a cardboard box with LED lights on the sides to create a consistent lighting fixture to be used for pictures of stacks. Over time, I refined my prototype to include lights, which I diffused with parchment paper, which led to more consistent and accurate results from the model. For programming and automation, I created an automated shipping label notification flow in Power Automate. I used connectors with SharePoint, Office 365 Groups, Outlook, Excel, and Microsoft Forms. The automation is triggered through a form submission where users must submit an image of a shipping label. The flow then detects text using OCR (optical character recognition) and then runs an Office script that I made to find matches of member names. The script ranks the top three matches using a fuzzy matching algorithm that I made by using the Levenshtein distance algorithm. It then sends out emails to notify the appropriate perfect or partial name matches of their packages arriving at the shipping office. I learned about how to handle edge cases with bad input images through this automation, as well as how to create clean and readable code and automation flows.",
        descriptionFive: "Overall, I learned about what it takes to implement a machine learning project and how to apply my skills in a real-world environment. I collaborated with other team members, improved my depth and breadth of understanding, problem-solving, and personal organizational skills in a fascinating industry, which will benefit me in becoming a software engineer.",
        descriptionSix: "I want to acknowledge my manager, Michael Lue, and the IT Solutions Developer, Eduardo Assis, for teaching me about how to approach building solutions, providing valuable feedback on how to improve, and for mentoring me throughout my internship.
