        description: "IceGram is a photo gallery web app created with React and Firebase. This was an edit of the project tutorial called FireGram which can be found here: https://github.com/iamshaunjp/firegram. Users can add images to the site and view them later as they are saved in a non-relational database. I learned how to use Firebase's firestore and storage in order to save images. I also used the framer-motion library to aid in creating aesthetically pleasing animations for adding images to the webpage.",
